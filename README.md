## Contribute to open source
🌟 I am an active contributor to open source projects, passionate about enhancing and extending the capabilities of software through collaborative development. A notable contribution of mine is to the [mapping-rs](https://github.com/EmilyMatt/mapping-rs) project 🌍, where I focused on geographic calculations essential for mapping applications. My work involved implementing the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) 📐 — a key equation used to determine the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, given their latitudes and longitudes. Additionally, I developed functionality to calculate the bearing 🧭 between two points, an essential feature for navigation and map orientation. This contribution underscores my commitment to improving software utility and accuracy, leveraging my skills to solve complex problems in open source projects. 💪🚀
